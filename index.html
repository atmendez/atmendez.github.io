		<p style="text-align:left;">I received my Ph.D. in <a href="http://politicalscience.stanford.edu/" rel="self">Political Science from Stanford University</a> in June, 2016. I study normative democratic theory and theories of justice. In 2012, I received Stanford&rsquo;s <a href="https://teachingcommons.stanford.edu/grants-awards/teaching-awards/centennial-teaching-assistant-awards" rel="self">Centennial Teaching Assistant Award</a> for outstanding teaching at the undergraduate level. For 2013 &ndash; 2015, I was a <a href="https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/current-vpge-fellows/dare-0" rel="self">Stanford DARE (Diversifying Academia, Recruiting Excellence)</a> doctoral fellow. I live in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bend,_Oregon" rel="self">Bend, Oregon</a> with my family.<br /><br />My research interests include equal opportunity, free speech and campaign finance regulations, the epistemic dimension of democratic governance and decision-making, and assessing the value of deliberation as a mechanism for problem-solving. My dissertation, entitled &ldquo;<a href="https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/11683528" rel="self">Equal Opportunity for Political Influence in Democratic Problem-Solving</a>,&rdquo; shows how equal opportunity enables democracy to effectively solve problems without sacrificing political equality.</p>
