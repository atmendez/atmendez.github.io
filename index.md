# Hello!

I received my Ph.D. in [Political Science from Stanford University](http://politicalscience.stanford.edu/) in June, 2016. I study normative democratic theory and theories of justice. In 2012, I received Stanford’s [Centennial Teaching Assistant Award](https://teachingcommons.stanford.edu/grants-awards/teaching-awards/centennial-teaching-assistant-awards) for outstanding teaching at the undergraduate level. For 2013 — 2015, I was a [Stanford DARE (Diversifying Academia, Recruiting Excellence)](https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/current-vpge-fellows/dare-0) doctoral fellow. I live in [Bend, Oregon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bend,_Oregon) with my family.

My research interests include equal opportunity, free speech and campaign finance regulations, the epistemic dimension of democratic governance and decision-making, and assessing the value of deliberation as a mechanism for problem-solving. My dissertation, entitled [Equal Opportunity for Political Influence in Democratic Problem-Solving](https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/11683528) shows how equal opportunity enables democracy to effectively solve problems without sacrificing political equality.
